# Flutter Windows Build Fix Guide

The Flutter Windows build is failing due to missing Visual Studio components. Here are the solutions:

## Quick Fix Options

### Option 1: Remove Problematic Dependencies (Fastest)
Some dependencies in your pubspec.yaml are causing Windows build issues. Let's temporarily remove them:

1. Edit `code/pubspec.yaml`
2. Comment out or remove these lines:
   ```yaml
   # permission_handler: ^11.3.1  # Causes Windows build issues
   # share_plus: ^7.2.1          # Causes Windows build issues  
   ```
3. Keep only essential dependencies for core functionality

### Option 2: Install Missing Visual Studio Components
1. Open **Visual Studio Installer**
2. Modify your Visual Studio 2022 installation
3. Add these workloads:
   - **Desktop development with C++**
   - **Game development with C++** (includes required tools)
4. Individual components needed:
   - **Windows 10/11 SDK** (latest version)
   - **MSVC v143 compiler toolset**
   - **CMake tools for C++**
   - **NuGet package manager**

### Option 3: Use Flutter with Minimal Dependencies
Create a minimal working version first, then add features gradually.
